	<h1 style="font-size: 44;">What is 'Pandemic'</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		Pandemics are large-scale outbreaks of infectious disease that can greatly increase morbidity and mortality over a wide geographic area and cause significant economic, social, and political disruption. Evidence suggests that the likelihood of pandemics has increased over the past century because of increased global travel and integration, urbanization, changes in land use, and greater exploitation of the natural environment. These trends likely will continue and will intensify. Significant policy attention has focused on the need to identify and limit emerging outbreaks that might lead to pandemics and to expand and sustain investment to build preparedness and health capacity.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">Risks of Pandemics</h1>

	<ul>
		<li style="font-size: 25">Pandemics have occurred throughout history and appear to be increasing in frequency, particularly because of the increasing emergence of viral disease from animals.</li>

		<li style="font-size: 25">Pandemic risk is driven by the combined effects of spark risk (where a pandemic is likely to arise) and spread risk (how likely it is to diffuse broadly through human populations).</li>

		<li style="font-size: 25">Some geographic regions with high spark risk, including Central and West Africa, lag behind the rest of the globe in pandemic preparedness.</li>

		<li style="font-size: 25">Probabilistic modeling and analytical tools such as exceedance probability (EP) curves are valuable for assessing pandemic risk and estimating the potential burden of pandemics.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">Impacts of Pandemics</h1>

	<ul>
		<li style="font-size: 25">Pandemics can cause significant, widespread increases in morbidity and mortality and have disproportionately higher mortality impacts on LMICs.</li>

		<li style="font-size: 25">Pandemics can cause economic damage through multiple channels, including short-term fiscal shocks and longer-term negative shocks to economic growth.</li>

		<li style="font-size: 25">Individual behavioral changes, such as fear-induced aversion to workplaces and other public gathering places, are a primary cause of negative shocks to economic growth during pandemics.</li>

		<li style="font-size: 25">Some pandemic mitigation measures can cause significant social and economic disruption.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">Origin of Pandemics</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		Most new pandemics have originated through the “zoonotic” transmission of pathogens from animals to humans, and the next pandemic is likely to be a zoonosis as well. Zoonoses enter into human populations from both domesticated animals and wildlife. Many historically significant zoonoses were introduced through increased human-animal interaction following domestication, and potentially high-risk zoonoses (including avian influenzas) continue to emerge from livestock production systems. Some pathogens (including Ebola) have emerged from wildlife reservoirs and entered into human populations through the hunting and consumption of wild species (such as bushmeat), the wild animal trade, and other contact with wildlife.
		<br><br>
		Zoonotic pathogens vary in the extent to which they can survive within and spread between human hosts. The degree of zoonotic adaptation spans a continuum from transmission only within animal populations (stage 1) to transmission only within human populations (stage 5). Most zoonotic pathogens are not well adapted to humans (stages 2–3), emerge sporadically through spillover events, and may lead to localized outbreaks, called stuttering chains. These episodes of “viral chatter” increase pandemic risk by providing opportunities for viruses to become better adapted to spreading within a human population. Pathogens that are past stage 3 are of the greatest concern, because they are sufficiently adapted to humans to cause long transmission chains between humans (directly or indirectly through vectors), and their geographic spread is not constrained by the habitat range of an animal reservoir.
