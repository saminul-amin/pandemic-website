    <p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
    	Not all infectious disease terms are created equal, though often they’re mistakenly used interchangeably. The distinction between the words “pandemic,” “epidemic,” and “endemic” is regularly blurred, even by medical experts. This is because the definition of each term is fluid and changes as diseases become more or less prevalent over time.
    	<br><br>
    	The spread and rate of new cases can be classified as:
    	<ul style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
    		<li><b>Endemic</b> describes a disease that is present permanently in a region or population</li>
    		<li><b>Epidemic</b> is an outbreak that affects many people at one time and can spread through one or several communities</li>
    		<li><b>Pandemic</b> is the term used to describe an epidemic when the spread is global.</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 44">Endemic</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
    	Endemic is derived from Greek <i>en</i> meaning 'in' and <i>demos</i> meaning people. It is used to describe a disease that is present at an approximately constant level within a society or country. Each country may have a disease that is unique, for example
    	<ul style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
    		<img src="300px-Ae_aegypti_ae_albopictus.jpg" alt="Aedes aegypti" style="float: right; margin-left: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
    		<li>
    			Caribbean Dengue is still present due to a failure to eradicate the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito. Dengue first appeared in the Americas and the Caribbean and with the assistance of the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) in the 1950s and 1960s the Americas were largely able to eradicate the presence of the Aedes Aegypti virtually eliminating the occurrence of Dengue. However, failure to eradicate its presence in the Caribbean resulted in the continued transmission throughout the region and more recently it has found its way back into the Americas causing several epidemics.
    		</li>
    		<li>
    			Varicella, more commonly known as chickenpox in the UK. It is more common in children under the age of 10, who often only experience mild symptoms and after exposure develop a natural immunity to the virus. Although there is a vaccine available it is only offered to those who are seen as vulnerable.
    		</li>
    		<li>
    			Malaria is another infectious disease that is endemic to Africa; through education and implementing countrywide strategies the cases of Malaria are now falling.
    		</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 44">Epidemic</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
    	An epidemic is derived from Greek <i>epi</i> meaning 'upon' or 'above' and <i>demos</i> meaning 'people' and is the term used to describe a situation where a disease spreads rapidly to a large number of people in a given population over a short time period. It is also used to describe any problem that has grown out of control.
    	<br><br>
    	The term epidemic is not just used with infectious diseases. It is also used with any scenario that leads to a detrimental rise of health risks within a society. For example, The rise in obesity globally (often described as an "obesity epidemic"). 
    	<br><br>
    	When the term epidemic is used in connection with infectious diseases it is due to the sudden rise of cases usually resulting from a new infectious agent or a change in an existing agent, for example:
    	<ul style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
    		<li>An agent moving between host populations, for example moving from animals to humans(zoonotic diseases).</li>
    		<li>A genetic change (mutation) in the infectious agent, eg bacteria, virus, fungi or parasite.</li>
    		<li>Introduction of new pathogens to a host population.</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
    	Epidemics can follow predictable patterns and these trends are often used to monitor, predict and control the spread of the infection. A typical example of this is seasonal flu.
    </p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 44">Pandemic</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
    	A pandemic is derived from Greek <i>pan</i> meaning 'all' and <i>demos</i> meaning 'people' and is the term used to describe the rapid spread of a transmissible infectious/communicable disease over several continents or worldwide. Once an epidemic becomes global and affects a large percent of the population it becomes known as a pandemic. The terms pandemic and epidemic are used to describe the rate and distance of the spread of the disease and not the severity of the disease. Significant features of a pandemic are listed below:
    	<ul style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
    		<li>Affects a wider geographical area, often global.</li>
    		<li>Infects a very large number of people.</li>
    		<li>Often caused by a new virus or a new strain of a virus that has been dormant for many years.</li>
    		<li>Spreads quickly in humans as there is little to no existing immunity.</li>
    		<li>Can cause a high number of deaths.</li>
    		<li>Because of the need to control the spread of the disease, there is often social disruption, unrest and economic loss.</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>
