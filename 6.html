		In the realm of infectious diseases, a pandemic is the worst case scenario. When an epidemic spreads beyond a country’s borders, that’s when the disease officially becomes a pandemic.
		<br><br>
		Communicable diseases existed during humankind’s hunter-gatherer days, but the shift to agrarian life 10,000 years ago created communities that made epidemics more possible. Malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, influenza, smallpox and others first appeared during this period.
		<br><br>
		The more civilized humans became, building cities and forging trade routes to connect with other cities, and waging wars with them, the more likely pandemics became. Let's see a number of pandemics that, in ravaging human populations, changed history.	
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">ANTONINE PLAGUE (165 AD)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		<b>Death Toll:</b> 5 million<br>
		<b>Cause:</b> Unknown<br>
		The Antonine plague was possibly an early appearance of smallpox that began with the Huns. The Huns then infected the Germans, who passed it to the Romans and then returning troops spread it throughout the Roman empire. Symptoms included fever, sore throat, diarrhea and, if the patient lived long enough, pus-filled sores. This plague continued until about 180 A.D., claiming Emperor Marcus Aurelius as one of its victims.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">CYPRIAN PLAGUE (250 AD)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		<b>Death Toll:</b> Unknown<br>
		<b>Cause:</b> Unknown<br>
		Named after the first known victim, St. Cyprian, a Christian bishop of Carthage (a city in Tunisia) who described the epidemic as signaling the end of the world. The Plague of Cyprian is estimated to have killed 5000 people a day in Rome alone. It entailed diarrhea, vomiting, throat ulcers, fever and gangrenous hands and feet. City dwellers fled to the country to escape infection but instead spread the disease further. Possibly starting in Ethiopia, it passed through Northern Africa, into Rome, then onto Egypt and northward. There were recurring outbreaks over the next three centuries. In 444 A.D., it hit Britain and obstructed defense efforts against the Picts and the Scots, causing the British to seek help from the Saxons, who would soon control the island.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">JUSTINIAN PLAGUE (541 AD)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		<b>Death Toll:</b> 50 million<br>
		<b>Cause:</b> Bubonic Plague<br>
		First appearing in Egypt, the Justinian plague spread through Palestine and the Byzantine Empire, and then throughout the Mediterranean. The plague changed the course of the empire, squelching Emperor Justinian's plans to bring the Roman Empire back together and causing massive economic struggle. It is also credited with creating an apocalyptic atmosphere that spurred the rapid spread of Christianity. Recurrences over the next two centuries eventually killed about 50 million people, <b>26 percent of the world population</b>. It is believed to be the first significant appearance of the bubonic plague, which features enlarged lymphatic gland and is carried by rats and spread by fleas.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">LEPROSY (11th Century)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		Though it had been around for ages, leprosy grew into a pandemic in Europe in the Middle Ages, resulting in the building of numerous leprosy-focused hospitals to accommodate the vast number of victims. A slow-developing bacterial disease that causes sores and deformities, leprosy was believed to be a punishment from God that ran in families. This belief led to moral judgments and ostracization of victims. Now known as Hansen’s disease, it still afflicts tens of thousands of people a year and can be fatal if not treated with antibiotics.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">THE BLACK DEATH (1346 - 1353)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		<b>Death Toll:</b> 200 million<br>
		<b>Cause:</b> Bubonic Plague<br>
		<img src="resize-1593076842792839677blackdeath.jpg" alt="The black death" style="float: right; margin-left: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
		Responsible for the death of one-third of the world population, this second large outbreak of the bubonic plague possibly started in Asia and moved west in caravans. Entering through Sicily in 1347 A.D. when plague sufferers arrived in the port of Messina, it spread throughout Europe rapidly. Dead bodies became so prevalent that many remained rotting on the ground and created a constant stench in cities. England and France were so incapacitated by the plague that the countries called a truce to their war. The British feudal system collapsed when the plague changed economic circumstances and demographics. Ravaging populations in Greenland, Vikings lost the strength to wage battle against native populations, and their exploration of North America halted.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE (1492)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		Following the arrival of the Spanish in the Caribbean, diseases such as smallpox, measles and bubonic plague were passed along to the native populations by the Europeans. With no previous exposure, these diseases devastated indigenous people, with as many as 90 percent dying throughout the north and south continents.
		<br><br>
		Upon arrival on the island of Hispaniola, Christopher Columbus encountered the Taino people, population 60,000. By 1548, the population stood at less than 500. This scenario repeated itself throughout the Americas.
		<br><br>
		In 1520, the Aztec Empire was destroyed by a smallpox infection. The disease killed many of its victims and incapacitated others. It weakened the population so they were unable to resist Spanish colonizers and left farmers unable to produce needed crops.
		<br><br>
		Research in 2019 even concluded that the deaths of some 56 million Native Americans in the 16th and 17th centuries, largely through disease, may have altered Earth’s climate as vegetation growth on previously tilled land drew more CO2 from the atmosphere and caused a cooling event.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">THE GREAT PLAGUE OF LONDON (1665)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		In another devastating appearance, the bubonic plague led to the deaths of 20 percent of London’s population. As human death tolls mounted and mass graves appeared, hundreds of thousands of cats and dogs were slaughtered as the possible cause and the disease spread through ports along the Thames. The worst of the outbreak tapered off in the fall of 1666, around the same time as another destructive event—the <a href="https://www.history.com/news/when-london-burned-1666s-great-fire">Great Fire of London</a>.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">THE THIRD CHOLERA PANDEMIC (1852–1860)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		<b>Death Toll:</b> 1 million<br>
		<b>Cause:</b> Cholera<br>
		Generally considered the most deadly of the seven cholera pandemics, the third major outbreak of Cholera in the 19th century lasted from 1852 to 1860. Like the first and second pandemics, the Third Cholera Pandemic originated in India, spreading from the Ganges River Delta before tearing through Asia, Europe, North America and Africa and ending the lives of over a million people. British physician John Snow, while working in a poor area of London, tracked cases of cholera and eventually succeeded in identifying contaminated water as the means of transmission for the disease. Unfortunately the same year as his discovery (1854) went down as the worst year of the pandemic, in which 23,000 people died in Great Britain.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">THE FLU PANDEMIC (1889-1890)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		<b>Death Toll:</b> 1 million<br>
		<b>Cause:</b> Influenza<br>
		Originally the “Asiatic Flu” or “Russian Flu” as it was called, this strain was thought to be an outbreak of the Influenza A virus subtype H2N2, though recent discoveries have instead found the cause to be the Influenza A virus subtype H3N8. The first cases were observed in May 1889 in three separate and distant locations, Bukhara in Central Asia (Turkestan), Athabasca in northwestern Canada, and Greenland. Rapid population growth of the 19th century, specifically in urban areas, only helped the flu spread, and before long the outbreak had spread across the globe. Though it was the first true epidemic in the era of bacteriology and much was learned from it. In the end, the 1889-1890 Flu Pandemic claimed the lives of over a million individuals.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">THE FLU PANDEMIC (1918)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		<b>Death Toll:</b> 50 million<br>
		<b>Cause:</b> Influenza<br>
		The avian-borne flu that resulted in 50 million deaths worldwide, the 1918 flu was first observed in Europe, the United States and parts of Asia before swiftly spreading around the world. At the time, there were no effective drugs or vaccines to treat this killer flu strain. Wire service reports of a flu outbreak in Madrid in the spring of 1918 led to the pandemic being called the “Spanish flu.” By October, hundreds of thousands of Americans died and body storage scarcity hit crisis level. But the flu threat disappeared in the summer of 1919 when most of the infected had either developed immunities or died.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">THE ASIAN FLU (1956-1958)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		<b>Death Toll:</b> 2 million<br>
		<b>Cause:</b> Influenza<br>
		Starting in Hong Kong and spreading throughout China and then into the United States, the Asian flu became widespread in England where, over six months, 14,000 people died. A second wave followed in early 1958, causing an estimated total of about 1.1 million deaths globally, with 116,000 deaths in the United States alone. A vaccine was developed, effectively containing the pandemic.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">HIV/AIDS (1981 - present)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		<img src="resize-15930827102019340531unnamed.png" alt="HIV/AIDS" style="float: right; margin-left: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
		<b>Death Toll:</b> 36 million<br>
		<b>Cause:</b> HIV/AIDS<br>
		First identified in Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976, HIV/AIDS has truly proven itself as a global pandemic, killing more than 36 million people since 1981. Currently there are between 31 and 35 million people living with HIV, the vast majority of those are in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 5% of the population is infected, roughly 21 million people. As awareness has grown, new treatments have been developed that make HIV far more manageable, and many of those infected go on to lead productive lives. Between 2005 and 2012 the annual global deaths from HIV/AIDS dropped from 2.2 million to 1.6 million.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">SARS (2003)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		First identified in 2003 after several months of cases, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome is believed to have possibly started with bats, spread to cats and then to humans in China, followed by 26 other countries, infecting 8,096 people, with 774 deaths.
		<br><br>
		SARS is characterized by respiratory problems, dry cough, fever and head and body aches and is spread through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes.
		<br><br>
		Quarantine efforts proved effective and by July, the virus was contained and hasn’t reappeared since. China was criticized for trying to suppress information about the virus at the beginning of the outbreak.
		<br><br>
		SARS was seen by global health professionals as a wake-up call to improve outbreak responses, and lessons from the pandemic were used to keep diseases like H1N1, Ebola and Zika under control.
	</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">EBOLA (2013 - 2016)</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		<b>Death Toll:</b> 12 thousand<br>
		<b>Cause:</b> <i>Ebolavirus</i><br>
		<img src="resize-15930833871300187972ebola.jpg" alt="Ebola" style="float: right; margin-left: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
		The Ebola outbreak that erupted in West Africa between 2013 and 2016 caused more than 11,300 deaths. The West African Ebola outbreak started in Guinea in December 2013, and the virus spread to 28,616 people in West African countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leona. The epidemic, which ended in June 2016, was recorded as the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history in terms of the number of people infected and amount of deaths.
		<br><br>
		Ebola virus was first detected in 1976. Its suspected origin is forest bats. It is not an airborne virus but is transmitted through blood, vomit, diarrhea and other bodily fluids. Symptoms generally appear between two and 21 days after infection, and recovery greatly depends on the patient’s immune response. People who recover from Ebola develop antibodies that last for at least 10 years.
