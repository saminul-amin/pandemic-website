	<h1 style="font-size: 44">COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		The COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Bangladesh in March 2020. The first three known cases were reported on 8 March 2020 by the country's epidemiology institute, IEDCR. Infections remained low until the end of March but saw a steep rise in April. In the week ending on 11 April, new cases in Bangladesh grew by 1,155 percent, the highest in Asia, ahead of Indonesia, with 186 percent. The capital city of Dhaka is currently the most affected district.

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">initial phase of COVID-19 in Bangladesh</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		On 22 January, the authorities at the Dhaka airport put the airports on alert by screening travellers from China.
		<br><br>
		On 1 February, a special flight from Bangladesh evacuated 312 Bangladeshi citizens stranded in Wuhan. The evacuees were quarantined for 14 days at the Ashkona Hajj Camp in Dhaka and other locations. None of them tested positive for the coronavirus.
		<br><br>
		On 8 March, the first three coronavirus cases were confirmed. They included two men that recently returned from Italy and a female relative. On the same day, the government decided to scale down the grand ceremony planned for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's birth centenary on 17 March.
		<br><br>
		On 15 March, 142 passengers returned from Italy, who were also taken to the Ashkona Hajj camp. After they complained about the unsanitary conditions there, many of them were allowed to go home with advice to self-isolate. Health experts expressed serious reservations about the action.
		<br><br>
		On 18 March, Bangladesh reported its first coronavirus death. The patient was aged over 70 and had other morbidities. By the end of March Bangladesh had reported 51 confirmed cases and five deaths.

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">Government Response in Bangladesh</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		On 2 February, the government of Bangladesh decided to suspend on-arrival visas for Chinese visitors The Chittagong port also announced that as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus from the ships that bring goods from around the world, the port health officer would examine all sailors of the ships coming from the East Asian countries. On 14 March, on-arrival visas were suspended for all countries, and flights from all European countries other than the United Kingdom were stopped.
		<br><br>
		On 17 March, when Bangladesh had 8 confirmed cases, the government closed all schools, for the remainder of March. Dhaka University was also closed for the same period.[37] This reportedly increased tourist traffic at the beaches in Chittagong and Cox's Bazar, counteracting the government measure.[18] The government also failed to ban congregational prayers in mosques and the Imams refused to follow guidance from the Islamic Foundation.[38] Atlantic Council scholars Irfan Norruddin and Rudabeh Shahid called the government measures contradictory with "lack-luster enforcement".
		<br><br>
		The government asked the Army to enforce social distancing.[43] ABC News Australia reported that 290 teams of soldiers were deployed across the country, that streets were empty in the capital Dhaka and the roadside shops were closed. It also said that thousands of people left Dhaka for their home villages.
		<br><br>
		On 9 April, Bangladesh imposed a 'complete lockdown' on the Cox's Bazar District where the majority of the Rohingya refugee camps are located. "No entry, no exit â€“ until the situation improves", said the government directive.

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">Disinformation in Bangladesh</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		Some people have been arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the coronavirus pandemic.[50] According to Human Rights Watch, "Since mid-March 2020, the authorities have apparently arrested at least a dozen people, including a doctor, opposition activists, and students, for their comments about coronavirus, most of them under the draconian Digital Security Act."

	<h1 style="font-size: 44">Economic Impact on Bangladesh</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 25; text-align: justify;">
		Even though garment factories were allowed to continue operating under the country's lockdown, an estimated one million garment workers, or one-quarter of the workforce, were laid off due to declining orders for export. On 5 April, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced a stimulus package amounting to some US$8bn.
