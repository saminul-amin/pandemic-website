		<b>Coronavirus is continuing its spread across the world, with more than nine million confirmed cases in 188 countries. Nearly 500,000 people have lost their lives.</b>
		<br><br>
		The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It then spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. While some countries are now starting to see confirmed cases and deaths fall following strict lockdown restrictions, others are still seeing figures rise.
		<br><br>
		A sharp increase in cases in Latin America in the second half of May led the World Health Organization (WHO) to say the Americas were the new centre of the pandemic. But there have also been new spikes in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
		<br><br>
		A chart of reported cases and deaths by country is given below:<br><br>

		<i style="font-size: 14; text-align: right;">From <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries">Worldometer</a>.</i><br><br>
		Brazil is regularly recording more than 1,000 deaths a day. It is only the second country in the world, after the US, to have confirmed more than one million cases. The death toll is now more than 55,000.<br>
		India and Pakistan have also seen a surge in infections and deaths - although the number of new cases in the latter has fallen slightly in recent days. The healthcare systems in both countries are under strain.<br><br>
		Spread-map of total cases are given below:

		Globally, the true number of cases is thought to be much higher than the reported figures, as many people with milder symptoms have not been tested and counted.
		<br>
		The WHO has warned that the pandemic is a long way from being over and says people should be prepared for new outbreaks, especially in areas where lockdowns are eased.
		<br>
		The United Nations World Food Programme has also warned that the pandemic could almost double the number of people suffering acute hunger.
